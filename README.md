---

![Project Overview](رابط-الصورة)

### **Project Description:**

This project aims to analyze hotel booking data to understand the factors influencing customer behavior and booking decisions. The dataset includes comprehensive booking information for both city hotels and resort hotels, such as hotel type, booking lead time, length of stay, number of guests, and customer special requests.

By examining booking patterns, cancellations, and customer preferences, we aim to provide insights that can help:

- Improve hotel management strategies.
- Optimize occupancy rates and reduce cancellations.
- Enhance customer satisfaction and experience.

### **Objectives:**

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values and identify outliers to ensure data quality and accuracy.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Create visualizations to explore key trends and patterns in booking data, focusing on factors that may impact booking decisions and customer behavior.

3. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Examine relationships between variables such as lead time, hotel type, and special requests to identify factors affecting booking and cancellation rates.

4. **Data Preparation for Predictive Modeling:**
   - Prepare the data by encoding categorical features and normalizing numerical variables for future predictive analysis.

### **Analysis Steps:**

⓵ **Data Cleaning:**
   - Address missing values (e.g., children, agents, and company data) and ensure data consistency.

⓶ **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Analyze general trends and distributions, such as stay duration, guest count, and hotel type.

⓷ **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Utilize a correlation matrix to examine the relationships between features like lead time, room type, and average daily rate (ADR).

⓸ **Business Questions:**

   ### **Key Business Questions:**

   1. What is the average length of stay for each hotel type?
   2. Which marketing channels are the most effective for booking?
   3. How many bookings include a parking request?
   4. What are the booking patterns across different months of the year?

⓹ **Data Preparation for Modeling:**
   - Encode categorical features (e.g., hotel type, marketing channel) and normalize numerical data (e.g., lead time, ADR) for predictive modeling.
